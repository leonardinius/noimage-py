        	This is copycast and ripoff of popular <a href="dummyimage.com">DummyImage</a> service, 
        	&copy;by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kingkool68">Russell Heimlich</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        	I liked the idea and nevertheless there is already python port available - 
        	<a href="http://ipsumimage.appspot.com">Ipsum Image</a>. 
        	I decided to re-implement that myself. The decision was not driven by lack of 
        	functionality of existing solutions, the ultimate goal was (and still is) to learn and 
        	play with Python snake a little bit more. &quot;Learning by doing&quot; way.
